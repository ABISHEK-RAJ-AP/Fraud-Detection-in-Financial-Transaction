## Introduction

Financial fraud is a significant concern for businesses and individuals alike. Traditional methods of fraud detection may not be sufficient in today's digital age. Therefore, this project leverages machine learning to identify patterns in financial transactions that may indicate fraudulent behavior.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about credit card transactions, including various features such as transaction amount, time, and other anonymized features. The dataset contains both legitimate and fraudulent transactions. [](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## Setup

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure your dataset is named `credit_data.csv` and located in the same directory as the Python script.
3. Run the Python script `fraud_detection.py`.
4. Analyze the results to determine the accuracy of fraud detection.

## Results

The logistic regression model is trained on a balanced dataset created by combining a sample of legitimate transactions with all fraudulent transactions. The accuracy of the model is evaluated using both training and testing data. Additionally, a warning is provided about the imbalanced nature of the dataset, suggesting potential techniques to address this issue.
